# ML_Project_Regression_KCV
K-fold Cross Validation and Regression

The goal of this project is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in the Boston area using machine learning regression models. We use the Boston Housing Dataset and apply various regression techniques for accurate prediction. The project also incorporates K-fold cross-validation to ensure robust model evaluation.

ðŸ“š Concepts Explained
ðŸ“ˆ 1. Regression
Regression is a type of supervised learning technique used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. The goal of regression is to model the relationship between the dependent variable (target) and independent variables (features). In this project, we predict the median value of homes (MEDV) using features like crime rate, number of rooms, and property tax rate.

Types of Regression Used:

Linear Regression: Fits a straight line to minimize the error between predictions and actual values.
Ridge Regression: A linear regression model with L2 regularization to reduce overfitting.
Lasso Regression: A linear regression model with L1 regularization that can perform feature selection.
ðŸ”„ 2. K-Fold Cross Validation
K-Fold Cross Validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models in a more reliable way. The dataset is split into K equal parts, and the model is trained and tested K times, each time using a different part as the validation set and the remaining K-1 parts as the training set.

Why K-Fold Cross Validation?

Provides a more accurate estimate of model performance.
Reduces the risk of overfitting.
Ensures that each data point is used for both training and validation.
Example (5-Fold Cross Validation):

Split the data into 5 parts (folds).
Train on 4 folds and test on the remaining 1 fold. Repeat this process 5 times.
Average the results from each fold to get the final performance metric.
